## Topics Covered

### Part 1: Foundational Topics (Topics 1-4)
📄 **File**: `research/researcher-topics-1-4-report.md`

1. **Test Case Design** (Black-box techniques, decision tables, state machines)
2. **Test Automation Frameworks** (Selenium, Cypress, mobile testing)
3. **Performance & Load Testing** (JMeter, Gatling, monitoring)
4. **Mobile & Cross-browser Testing** (Appium, device clouds, emulators)

### Part 2: Advanced Topics (Topics 5-9) [COMPLETED]
📄 **File**: `research/researcher-topics-5-9-report.md` ✓

5. **API Testing & Mocking** (Postman, Newman, WireMock, GraphQL, OWASP)
6. **AI Testing Tools** (Healenium, Qodo, Applitools Eyes, Test Oracle)
7. **Testing AI Systems** (ML frameworks, bias/fairness, adversarial robustness, LLM evaluation)
8. **Database Testing** (ACID, DBUnit, indexes, migration, SQL injection)
9. **Domain Testing & Data Generation** (ECP, BVA, Faker, Mockaroo, pairwise testing)

## Quick Navigation

### For Application-Level Learning
- **Tool Comparisons**: See comparison tables in each topic (WireMock vs Postman, Faker vs Mockaroo, etc.)
- **Practical Scenarios**: Each topic includes "Application Scenario" sections with real-world examples
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Solutions to common testing problems (e.g., index optimization, API contract drift)

### For Exam Preparation
1. Read `RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md` for overview
2. Study Topics 1-4 (foundational)
3. Study Topics 5-9 (advanced)
4. Use "Exam Readiness Indicators" checklist
5. Practice scenario-based design exercises

### For Reference
- **Source URLs**: All research backed by official documentation, academic papers, vendor benchmarks
- **2025 Updates**: Latest framework versions and industry trends included
- **Unresolved Questions**: Listed at end of each section for deeper research

## Key Research Characteristics

✓ **APPLICATION-LEVEL**: Practical scenarios, tool comparisons, decision matrices
✓ **COMPREHENSIVE**: 5 advanced topics × 3-5 subtopics each
✓ **CONCISE**: 318 lines for Topics 5-9; information-dense
✓ **AUTHORITATIVE**: Cross-verified with 35+ sources (official docs, academic, industry)
✓ **2025-CURRENT**: Latest product updates, emerging trends, modern approaches

## Study Timeline Recommendation

**For 2-week exam prep:**
- Week 1: Topics 1-4 (foundational mastery)
- Week 1-2: Topics 5-9 (advanced techniques + integration)
- Week 2: Scenario practice, tool hands-on, weak area review

**For 1-week crunch prep:**
- Focus: Topics 5-9 (advanced) + integration patterns
- Skim: Topics 1-4 (review conceptually)
- Practice: Top 3 application scenarios per topic

## Using This Research

**For Study Groups**:
- Topic-based discussion: Each section is self-contained
- Debate tool choices: Use comparison tables as discussion frameworks
- Scenario exercises: Apply topics to team's codebase

**For Portfolio Building**:
- Implement examples: Run Newman, Healenium, Faker projects
- Document learnings: Write blog posts on complex topics (oracle problem, bias testing)
- GitHub repos: Showcase DBUnit test suites, GraphQL testing strategies

**For Interview Prep**:
- "Tell me about API testing approaches" → Reference WireMock vs Postman section
- "How would you test an ML model?" → Reference Topic 7 frameworks
- "Design a test strategy for data migration" → Reference Topic 8 3-phase approach
