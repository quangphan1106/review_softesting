KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS SUMMARY
================================================================================

Topic 5: API Testing
  → Newman 2025: Private runners eliminate VPN workarounds
  → WireMock Recording feature enables test data capture
  → GraphQL 69% vulnerability rate requires specialized security tooling

Topic 6: AI Testing Tools
  → Healenium LCS+ML outperforms rule-based locator recovery
