### Requirement Analysis

## Software testing life cycle

1.  Requirement Analysis
2.  Test Planning
3.  Test Case Design
4.  Environment Setup
5.  Test Execution
6.  Test Cycle Closure

## Requirement analysis

*   Test team
    *   studies the requirements
    *   from a testing point of view
    *   identify testable requirements
*   Interact with stakeholder
    *   to better understand
*   Requirements
    *   functional
    *   non-functional

## Requirement analysis

*   Activities
    *   Identify types of tests to be performed.
    *   Gather details about testing priorities and focus
    *   Prepare Requirement Traceability Matrix
    *   Identify test environment details
    *   Automation feasibility analysis (if required)

## Requirement analysis

*   Deliverables
    *   Requirement Traceability Matrix
    *   Automation Feasibility Report

## Requirements Traceability Matrix

*   Map and trace user requirement with test cases
*   Ensure that all requirements are tested (via test cases)
*   Parameters
    *   Requirement ID
    *   Requirement description
    *   Test case ID
    *   Test case status

## Requirements Traceability Matrix
### An example of RTM

| Req. ID | Req. description | Test case ID            | Status                                              |
| :------ | :--------------- | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| BR01    | Login            | TC01, TC02              | TC01 - Passed<br>TC02 - Passed                      |
| BR02    | Search product   | TC03, TC04, TC05        | TC03 - Passed<br>TC04 - Passed<br>TC05 - Failed    |
| BR03    | Place an order   | TC06, TC07, T08, TC09   | TC06 – Passed<br>TC07 - Passed<br>TC08 - Failed<br>TC09 - No run |
| ...     | ...              | ...                     | ...                                                 |

## Traceability Test Matrix

*   Types of Traceability Test Matrix
    *   Forward traceability
        *   Map requirements to test cases
        *   Make sure each requirement is tested
    *   Backward or reverse traceability
        *   Maps test cases to requirements
        *   Make sure the scope is not expanded
    *   Bi-directional traceability

## Automation Feasibility Report

*   Automation feasibility analysis
    *   Can the application be automated or not?
    *   What type of tool/ test automation framework can be used?
    *   How much automation is possible?
    *   In spite of high efforts, what's the value add in automating?
*   Automation feasibility checklist
