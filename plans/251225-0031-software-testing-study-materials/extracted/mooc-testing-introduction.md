# Software Testing

Testing is the process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software products and related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.

Source: **Glossary of Software Testing Terms**

# Static Testing vs. Dynamic Testing

*   Static Testing
    *   Examine the code
    *   NOT Execute it
    *   Code analysis, Code inspection, Code review...
*   Dynamic Testing
    *   Execute the code
    *   Without, necessarily, examine it

# Validation Testing vs. Verification Testing

*(Diagram showing User Requirements, Software, and Requirements Specification in a triangle. An arrow goes from User Requirements to Software, and another from Software to Requirements Specification for Validation.)*

**Validation**
Are we building
the correct
system?

**Verification**
Are we building
the system
correctly?

# Test Oracle

*(Diagram showing "Expected" and "Actual" in two connected boxes with arrows indicating comparison)*

*   **Test Oracle:** a source of information about whether the output of a program (or function or method) is correct or not

# Error - Fault - Failure

*(Diagram illustrating the progression from Error to Fault to Failure)*

A person makes an error ...
... that creates a fault in the software ...
Fault / Defect / Bug
... that can cause a failure in operation

# Testing vs. Debug

*   Testing: finding input that cause the program to fail
*   Debug: the process of finding a fault given by a failure

# Test Bed

*   The test execution environment configured for testing
    *   Hardware
    *   Software
    *   Operating system
    *   Network configuration
    *   The product/application under test (AUT)
    *   Other system/application
    *   ...

# Why must we test?

"A clever person solves a problem. A wise person avoids it"
Albert Einstein

**Software bugs could be expensive and even dangerous**

*(Images of a crashed airplane and a rocket explosion)*

Korean Air Flight 801 crashed, 1997
254 people dead & injured

Ariane 5 rocket exploded, 1996
$500 million lost

# Cost of fixing defects

*(Graph showing Percentage of Bugs and Cost to repair defects across different phases)*

**% Defects introduced in this phase** (Blue line)
**% Defects found in this phase** (Yellow line)
**$ Cost to repair defect in this phase** (Grey line)

**Phases:**
*   Coding: $25 (Low cost, high % defects introduced/found)
*   Unit Test: $100
*   Function Test: $250
*   System Test: $1000
*   After Release: $16,000 (High cost, low % defects introduced/found)

*Summary of graph trend:*
The percentage of bugs introduced and found is highest during the early phases like Coding (85%). The cost to repair defects increases significantly as the development lifecycle progresses, from $25 in Coding to $16,000 after Release.

# Objective of Testing

*   Detect Faults
*   Establish confidence in the software
*   Evaluate properties of the software
    *   Reliability
    *   Performance
    *   Memory usage
    *   Security
    *   Usability
    *   ...

# Objectives of Testing

*   Should NOT be to verify that the program works correctly
    *   If you can't test the program completely, you can't verify that it works correctly
    *   "Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not the absence" - Dijkstra

**If you set your mind to show that a program works correctly, you'll be more likely to miss problems than if you want and expect the program to fail.**

# Objectives of Testing

**The Objective of Testing a Program is to Find Problems**

Finding problems is the core of your work. You should want to find as many problems as possible. The more serious testers find, the better tester is.

A test that reveals a problem is a success. A test that did not reveal a problem is (often) a waste of time.

# Objectives of Testing

**The Purpose of Finding Problems is to Get Them Fixed**

The point of the exercise is quality improvement!

*   The best tester is not the one who finds the most bugs or who embarrasses the most programmers.
*   The best tester is the one who gets the most bugs fixed.

# Comparison between QA, QC and Testing

# Tester vs. Developer

*(Cartoon image of two bears, one labeled "DEVELOPER" and the other "TESTER". The developer says "HOW CAN I MAKE IT?" and the tester says "HOW CAN I BREAK IT?")*

They are not so much different,
but they have different path for the same goal,
to improve quality!!
