## Independent testing
*   A certain degree of independence often makes the tester more effective at finding defects due to differences between the author’s and the tester’s cognitive biases.

## Five degrees of independence
1.  No independent testers; developers test their own code.
2.  Independent developers or testers within the development teams or the project team.
3.  Independent test team or group within the organization.
4.  Independent testers from the business organization or user community, or within specializations in specific test types.
5.  Independent testers external to the organization, either working on-site (insourcing) or off-site (outsourcing)

## Benefits of independence
*   Independent testers are likely to recognize different kinds of failures.
*   An independent tester can verify, challenge or reject assumptions made by stakeholders.

## Drawbacks of independence
*   Isolation from the development team.
*   Developers may lose a sense of responsibility for quality.
*   Independent testers may be seen as bottleneck or blamed for delays in release.
*   Independent testers may back some important information.

## Planning - Risk Analysis and Solution - Definition
*   Risk is the probability of occurrence of an undesirable event.
*   Risk Analysis in Software Testing is the process of analyzing the risks associated with your Testing Project.
*   For the success of your project, Risk should be identified and corresponding solutions should be determined before the start of the project.
*   Risk Identification helps you to identify probable risks in the early stages.

## Planning - Risk Analysis and Solution - Benefit
*   Early forecast of unwanted situations in your project.
*   Estimate potential loss of such situations.
*   Make decision to deal with such situations.
*   Avoid the future consequences.

## Planning - Risk Analysis and Solution – 3-step process
1.  Identify the Risks
2.  Analyze Impact of each Identified Risk
3.  Take counter measures for the identified & Analyzed risk

*(Image Description: A flowchart with three steps: "Identify Risk" -> "Analyze Risk Impact" -> "Counter measures to Risk")*

## Step 1 – Identify Risk
*   **Project Risk**
    *   Uncertain event or activity that can impact the project's progress
*   **Product Risk**
    *   The possibility that the system or software might fail to satisfy or fulfill the expectation of the customer, user, or stakeholder

## Project Risk
*   Project risk can be defined as an uncertain event or activity that can impact the project’s progress.
*   The impact has a positive or negative effect on the prospects of achieving project objectives.

## Project Risk
*(Image Description: A diagram illustrating three types of Project Risk: "Organizational Risk", "Technical Risk", and "Business Risk", with an arrow indicating a flow between them.)*

## Project Risk – Organization Risk
*   It is a risk related to your human resource or your Testing team.
*   For example, in your project, lack of technically skilled members is a risk.
*   Not having enough manpower to complete the project on time is another risk.

## Project Risk – Organization Risk
| Role                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Test Manager**     | Manages the whole project and takes **full responsibility** for the project's success                                                                                                                    |
| **Test Administrator** | Builds up and ensures test environment and assets are **managed** and **maintained**                                                                                                                     |
| **Test Designer**    | Responsible for defining the test approach and ensuring it’s successful implementation                                                                                                                     |
| **Tester**           | Executes the test case on software product to ensure quality, design integrity and proper functionality.                                                                                                 |

## Project Risk – Organization Risk
*   Is this a well-organized Team?
    *   If No => Create stronger team and foster an environment of co-operation
*   Does each team member has the skill to do his/her job?
    *   If No => Build the training course to skill up members
*   Compare to project size and schedule, do we have enough human resource to finish this project at the deadline?
    *   If No => Ask the project board to get more human resource

## Project Risk – Technical Risk
*   Technical Risk is the probability of loss incurred during the execution of a technical process such as untested engineering, wrong testing procedure…
*   Example:
    *   Your task in this project is testing a banking website.
    *   You have to set up proper test environments which mirror real business environments.
    *   If the Test Environment is not setup properly, the product will be not be tested correctly and many defects will not be detected.

## Project Risk – Business Risk
*   The risk involves an external entity.
*   It is the risk which may come from your company, your customer but not from your project.

## Project Risk – Business Risk
*   Example.

*(Image Description: A comic strip depicting a conversation.
- Person 1 says: "Our company reported a big loss this year. I must **cut off** your project budget by half in next month."
- Person 2 says: "It's bad news!!! How can I manage the project with such **low** budget?"
- Person 1 says: "I know. But we have no other choice. Pls find a **solution** to deal with it.")*

## Project Risk – Business Risk
*   Solution.
    *   Set priority for the testing phases, focus on testing the main features of website
    *   Utilize a testing tool to increase the productivity of testing
    *   Apply process improvement to reduce the management effort.

## Project Risk – Product Risk
*   Product risk is the possibility that the system or software might fail to satisfy or fulfill the expectation of the customer, user, or stakeholder.

## Project Risk – Product Risk
*   Example.
    *   The software skips some key function that the customers specified in the users’requirement
    *   The software is unreliable and frequently fails to work.
    *   Software fail in ways that cause financial or other damage to a user or the company that uses the software.
    *   The software has problems related to a particular quality characteristic such as security, reliability, usability, maintainability or performance.

## Project Risk – Product Risk
*   Steps
    *   Step 1: Investigate the specification documents
    *   Step 2: Discuss with developer to know more about this website
    *   Step 3: Walk around the website as real user

## Step 2 – Analyze the impact of the risk occurring
*   Several risks from a specific project.
    *   You may not have enough human resource to finish the project on the deadline
    *   The Testing environment may not be setup properly like real business environment.
    *   Your project budget may cut by half because of business situation
    *   This website may lack security functions

## Step 2 – Analyze the impact of the risk occurring
*   Each risk should be classified on the basis of following two parameters:
    *   The probability of occurrence
    *   The impact on the project

## Step 2 – Analyze the impact of the risk occurring

| Probability | Description                                            |
| :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| High (3)    | Has very high probability to occur, may impact to the whole project |
| Medium (2)  | 50% chance to occur                                    |
| Low (1)     | Low probability of occurrence                          |

| Impact      | Description                                                    |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High (3)    | Cannot continue with project activity if it is not solved immediately |
| Medium (2)  | Cannot continue the project activity if it is not solved       |
| Low (1)     | Need to solve it but it is possible to take alternative solution for a while |

## Step 2 – Analyze the impact of the risk occurring

| Risk                        | Probability | Impact | Priority = Probability\*Impact |
| :-------------------------- | :---------- | :----- | :----------------------------- |
| Project deadline not met    | 3           | 3      | 9                              |
| Electricity Failure         | 1           | 2      | 2                              |

| Priority | Range | Risk Management Method                                       |
| :------- | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| High     | 6-9   | Take mitigation action immediately and monitor the risk every day until its status is closed. |
| Middle   | 3-5   | Monitor the risk every week at internal progress meeting     |
| Low      | 1-2   | Accept the risk and monitor the risk on milestone basis.     |

## Step 3 - Take COUNTERMEASURES to mitigate the risk
*(Image Description: A flowchart with three steps: "Risk response" -> "Register Risk" -> "Monitor and Control Risk")*

## Risk Response
*   **Avoidance**: Eliminate the risk, determinate this risk not become involved
*   **Reduction**: Take correct measures and mitigate plan to reduce the impact of risks
*   **Sharing**: Transfer the risk to other resource such as insource or insure
*   **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and prepare budget for this risk

## Risk Response - Example
*   You may not have enough human resource to finish the project at the deadline
    *   This risk cannot be avoided because of company’s situation; you cannot request more human resource for the project. In such case, you can reduce the impact of risks by choosing some options below
        *   Select the talented and experienced member to join the Project Team
        *   Create the training course to skill up the member, help them to improve the productivity

## Risk Response - Example
*   The testing environment may not be setup properly like real business environment
    *   This risk could be avoided if you do the following activities
        *   Ask the development team for their help to build up the test environment
        *   Prepare all the equipment or materials (Server, database, PC..) needed for setting up environment

## Risk Response - Example
*   Your project may cut by half because of business situation
    *   This risk is a critical; it may prevent the whole project from proceeding. In that case, you should do
        *   Re-define the project scope, identify what will be tested and what will be ignored in such case
        *   Negotiate with customer about the term of project to fit for the project budget
        *   Improve the productivity of each project phase such as testing, making test specs,…If you can save time, you can save cost

## Risk Response - Example
*   This website may lack security features
    *   This risk is considered as Medium priority, because it doesn’t affect to the whole project and could be avoided. You can request the development team to check and add these functions to the website.

## Register Risk
*   All the risk must be recorded, documented and acknowledged by project managers, stakeholder and the project member.
*   The risk register should be freely accessible to all the members of the project team.
*   There’re some useful to register risk such as Redmine, MITRE… etc.

## Monitor and Control Risk
*   Risks can be monitored on a continuous basis to check if any changes are made.
*   New risk can be identified through the constant monitoring and assessing mechanisms.

## Planning – Test Estimation
*   Test Estimation is approximately determining how long a task would take to complete.
*   Benefits of correct estimation:
    *   Accurate test estimates lead to better planning, execution, and monitoring of tasks under a test manager’s attention.
    *   Allow for more accurate scheduling and help realize results more confidently.

## What to Estimate?
*   Resources
*   Times
*   Human skill
*   Cost

## How to estimate?
*   Work Breakdown Structure
*   3-Point Software Testing Estimation Technique
*   Wideband Delphi technique
*   Function Point/Testing Point Analysis
*   Use Case Point Method
*   Percentage distribution
*   Ad-hoc method

## How to estimate?
*   **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**: Breaking down the test project into small pieces
*   **Three Point Estimation**: Estimation method is based on statistical data
*   **Functional Point Method**: Measure the size and give weightage to each function point

## How to estimate?
1.  Divide the whole project into the smallest tasks
2.  Allocate each task to team members
3.  Estimate the effort required to complete each task
4.  Validate the estimation

## Step 1 - Divide the whole project task into subtasks
*   To do this, you can use the Work Breakdown Structure technique.
*(Image Description: A hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure diagram showing "Project" broken into "Module 1", "Module 2", etc., which are further broken into "Sub module 1.1", "Sub module 1.2", etc., down to "Functionality".)*

## Step 1 - Divide the whole project task into subtasks
| Task                               | Sub task                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyze software requirement specification | Investigate the soft requirement specs; Interview with the developer & other stakeholders to know more about the website |
| Create the Test Specification      | Design test scenarios; Create test cases; Review and revise test cases         |
| Execute the test cases             | Build up the test environment; Execute the test cases; Review test execution results |
| Report the defects                 | Create the Defect reports; Report the defects                                  |

## Step 2 - Allocate each task to team member
| Task                               | Members                |
| :--------------------------------- | :--------------------- |
| Analyze software requirement specification | All the members        |
| Create the test specification      | Tester/Test Analyst    |
| Build up the test environment      | Test Administrator     |
| Execute the test cases             | Tester, Test Administrator |
| Report defects                     | Tester                 |

## Step 3 - Effort Estimation For Tasks
*   Functional Point Method
*   Three Point Estimation

## Method 1 - Function Point Method
1.  Step A) Size
2.  Step B) Duration
3.  Step C) Cost

## Step A - Estimate size for the task

## Step B - Estimate duration for the task
Total Effort = Total Function Points \* Estimate defined per Function Points

|             | Weightage | # of Function Points | Total |
| :---------- | :-------- | :------------------- | :---- |
| Complex     | 5         | 3                    | 15    |
| Medium      | 3         | 5                    | 15    |
| Simple      | 1         | 4                    | 4     |
| **Function Total Points** |           |                      | **34** |
| **Estimate define per point** |           |                      | **5** |
| **Total Estimated Effort (Person Hours)** |           |                      | **170 man-hours** |

## Step C - Estimate the cost for the tasks
*   Suppose, on average your team salary is $5 per hour.
*   The time required for “Create Test Specs” task is 170 hours.
*   Accordingly, the cost for the task is 5\*170= $850.
*   Now you can calculate budget for other activities in WBS and arrive at overall budget for the project.
*   As a project manager, you have to decide how to get the most return for your company’s investment.
*   The more accurate your estimate of project cost is, the better able you will be to manage your project’s budget.

## Method 2 - Three Point Estimation
*   In three-point estimation, three values are produced initially for every task based on prior experience or best-guesses as follows
    *   `a`: The best-case estimate
    *   `m`: The most likely estimate
    *   `b`: The worst case estimate

## Step 4 - Validate the estimation
*   Once you create an aggregate estimate for all the tasks mentioned in the WBS, you need to forward it to the management board, who will review and approve it.
*   The member of management board could comprise of the CEO, Project Manager & other stakeholders.
*   The management board will review and discuss your estimation plan with you. You may explain them your estimation logically and reasonably so that they can approve your estimation plan.

## Test estimation best practices
*   Add some buffer time
*   Account Resource planning in estimation
    *   What should you do if some members in your team take long leaves?
*   Use the past experience as reference
*   Stick to your estimation

*   Download the Software Test Estimation Excel on Guru99.

## Planning - Test Planning
*   A Test Plan can be defined as a document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended Testing activities.
*   In software testing, a test plan gives detailed testing information regarding an upcoming testing effort, including:
    *   Test Strategy
    *   Test Objective
    *   Exit /Suspension Criteria
    *   Resource Planning
    *   Test Deliverables

## What is the Importance of Test Plan?
*   Help people outside the test team such as developers, business managers, customers understand the details of testing.
*   Test Plan guides our thinking. It is like a rule book, which needs to be followed.
*   Important aspects like test estimation, test scope, Test Strategy are documented in Test Plan, so it can be reviewed by Management Team and re-used for other projects.

## How to write a Test Plan
*   IEEE 829 steps:
    1.  Analyze the product
    2.  Design Test strategy
    3.  Define Test objectives
    4.  Define Test criteria
    5.  Resource Planning
    6.  Plan Test Environment
    7.  Schedule & Estimation
    8.  Determine Test Deliverables

## Step 1 - Analyze the product
*   Who will use the website?
*   What is it used for?
*   How will it work?
*   What are software/ hardware the product uses?

## Step 1 - Analyze the product
*(Image Description: A circular diagram showing the steps for product analysis: "Interview client, designer and developer" -> "Review product and project documentation" -> "Perform product walkthrough", forming a cycle.)*

## Step 2 - Develop Test Strategy
*   The project’s testing objectives and the means to achieve them
*   Determines testing effort and costs
    *   Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
    *   Step 2.2 - Identify Testing Type
    *   Step 2.3 - Document Risk & Issues
    *   Step 2.4 - Create Test Logistics

## Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
*   Before the start of any test activity, scope of the testing should be known. You must think hard about it.
    *   The components of the system to be tested (hardware, software, middleware, etc.) are defined as “in scope“
    *   The components of the system that will not be tested also need to be clearly defined as being “out of scope.”

## Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
*   Defining the scope of your testing project is very important for all stakeholders. A precise scope helps you
    *   Give everyone a confidence & accurate information of the testing you are doing
    *   All project members will have a clear understanding about what is tested and what is not

## Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
*   How do you determine scope your project?
    *   Precise customer requirement
    *   Project Budget
    *   Product Specification
    *   Skills & talent of your test team

## Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
*   How do you determine scope your project? An example.
    *   As the software requirement specs, the project Guru99 Bank only focus on testing all the functions and external interface of website Guru99 Bank (in scope testing)
    *   Nonfunctional testing such as stress, performance or logical database currently will not be tested. (out of scope)

## Step 2.1 - Define Scope of Testing
*   Problem Scenario
    *   The customer wants you to test his API. But the project budget does not permit to do so.
    *   In such case you need to convince the customer that API Testing is extra work and will consume significant resources.
    *   Give him data supporting your facts.
    *   If API Testing is included in-scope the budget will increase by XYZ amount.

## Step 2.2 - Identify Testing Type
*   **Unit Test**: Test the smallest piece of verifiable software in the application
*   **API Testing**: Test the API’s created for the application
*   **Integration Test**: Individual software modules are combined and tested as a group
*   **System Test**: Conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system’s compliance with its specified requirements
*   **Install/Uninstall Testing**: Focuses on what customers will need to do to install /uninstall and set up/remove the new software successfully
*   **Agile Testing**: Testing the system using Agile methodology

## Step 2.3 - Document Risk & Issues

| Risk                                                          | Mitigation                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Team member lack the required skills for website testing.     | Plan training course to skill up your members                                                                                                     |
| The project schedule is too tight; it’s hard to complete this project on time | Set Test Priority for each of the test activity.                                                                                                  |
| Test Manager has poor management skill                        | Plan leadership training for manager                                                                                                              |
| A lack of cooperation negatively affects your employees’ productivity | Encourage each team member in his task, and inspire them to greater efforts.                                                                      |
| Wrong budget estimate and cost overruns                       | Establish the scope before beginning work, pay a lot of attention to project planning and constantly track and measure the progress                 |

## Step 2.4 - Create Test Logistics
*   Who will test?
*   When will the test occur?

## Step 2.4 - Create Test Logistics
*   Who will test?
*   Person having the following skills is most ideal for performing software testing:
    *   Ability to understand customers point of view
    *   Strong desire for quality
    *   Attention to detail
    *   Good cooperation

## Step 2.4 - Create Test Logistics
*   When will the test occur?
*(Image Description: A diagram showing "Test specs and Requirement document" + "Human resources" + "Test environment" = "Ready to Test".)*

## Step 3 - Define Test Objective
*   Test Objective is the overall goal and achievement of the test execution.
*   The objective of the testing is finding as many software defects as possible; ensure that the software under test is bug free before release.
*   To define the test objectives, you should do 2 following steps:
    *   List all the software features (functionality, performance, GUI…) which may need to test.
    *   Define the target or the goal of the test based on above features

## Step 3 - Define Test Objective
*(Image Description: A mind map for "Guru99 BANK" with the following main branches and some sub-branches:
*   **Functionality**: Change pass, Log out, Account (Deposit, Withdrawal, Balance, Enquiry), Login, New, Fund Transfer.
*   **Usability**: user friendly, clear contents.
*   **Security**: Account protection, Authorize access.
*   **UI**: Web elements (Button, Menu, Text, Image, HTML/CSS, Links), Website Layout.
*   **Performance**: Load Test, Stress Test.
*   **Compatibility**
*   **Hardware** (connected to Database server).
*   Also connected to "Guru99 BANK": Web server, Mail server.)*

## Step 3 - Define Test Objective
*   Based on above features, you can define the Test Objective of the project Guru99 as following:
    *   Check that whether website Guru99 functionality(Account, Deposit…) is working as expected without any error or bugs in real business environment
    *   Check that the external interface of the website such as UI is working as expected and & meet the customer need
    *   Verify the usability of the website. Are those functionalities convenient for user or not?

## Step 4 - Define Test Criteria
*   Suspension Criteria
    *   Specify the critical suspension criteria for a test. If the suspension criteria are met during testing, the active test cycle will be suspended until the criteria are resolved.
*   Example.
    *   If your team members report that there are 40% of test cases failed, you should suspend testing until the development team fixes all the failed cases.

## Step 4 - Define Test Criteria
*(Image Description: A flowchart illustrating the suspension criteria process:
1.  Define suspension criteria
2.  Execute Test cases
3.  Decision: Suspension criteria met?
    *   NO: Finish the testing
    *   YES: Suspend the testing
4.  Decision (after suspending): Developer fix the fail cases?
    *   NO: Loop back to "Suspend the testing"
    *   YES: Loop back to "Execute Test cases")*

## Step 4 - Define Test Criteria
*   Exit Criteria
    *   It specifies the criteria that denote a successful completion of a test phase.
    *   The exit criteria are the targeted results of the test and are necessary before proceeding to the next phase of development.
*   Example: 95% of all critical test cases must pass.

## Step 4 - Define Test Criteria
*   Exit Criteria.
    *   Run rate is ratio between number test cases executed/total test cases of test specification. For example, the test specification has total 120 TCs, but the tester only executed 100 TCs, So the run rate is 100/120 = 0.83 (83%)
    *   Pass rate is ratio between numbers test cases passed / test cases executed. For example, in above 100 TCs executed, there’re 80 TCs that passed, so the pass rate is 80/100 = 0.8 (80%)

## Step 4 - Define Test Criteria
*   Exit Criteria.
    *   Run rate is mandatory to be 100% unless a clear reason is given.
    *   Pass rate is dependent on project scope, but achieving high pass rate is a goal.

## Step 5 - Resource Planning – Human Resource

## Step 6 - Plan Test Environment
*   A testing environment is a setup of software and hardware on which the testing team is going to execute test cases.
*   The test environment consists of real business and user environment, as well as physical environments, such as server, front end running environment.

## Step 6 - Plan Test Environment
*   What is the maximum user connection which this website can handle at the same time?
*   What are hardware/software requirements to install this website?
*   Does the user’s computer need any particular setting to browse the website?

## Step 7 - Schedule & Estimation
*   Employee and project deadline
*   Project estimation
*   Project Risk

## Execution - Test Monitoring and Control
*   What will you do when your project runs out of resources or exceeds the time schedule?
    *   You need to Monitor and Control Test activities to bring it back on schedule.
*   Test Monitoring and Control is the process of overseeing all the metrics necessary to ensure that the project is running well, on schedule, and not out of budget.

## Test Monitoring
*   Monitoring is a process of collecting, recording, and reporting information about the project activity that the project manager and stakeholder needs to know
*   To Monitor, Test Manager does the following activities:
    *   Define the project goal, or project performance standard
    *   Observe the project performance, and compare the actual and the planned performance expectations
    *   Record and report any detected problem which happens to the project

## Test Controlling
*   Project Controlling is a process of using data from monitoring activity to bring actual performance to planned performance.
*   In this step, the Test Manager takes action to correct the deviations from the plan.
*   In some cases, the plan has to be adjusted according to project situation.

## Execution - Issue Management

## Execution - Test Report & Evaluation
*   The project has already been completed. It’s now time to look back at what you have done.
*   “Test Evaluation Report” describes the results of the Testing in terms of Test coverage and exit criteria.
*   The data used in Test Evaluation are based on the test results data and test result summary.
