1.  Introduction   This  report  applies  domain  testing  techniques  to  analyze  three  main  features  from  the  
Practice
 
Software
 
Testing
 
application
 
(Sprint

-
 
with
 
bugs
 
version:
 https://with-bugs.practicesoftwaretesting.com).  The  analysis  focuses  on  three  different  user  types  and  follows  the  4-step  domain  testing  approach:  identifying  inputs/outputs,  
identifying
 
equivalence
 
classes,
 
selecting
 
test
 
cases,
 
and
 
performing
 
boundary
 
value
 
analysis.
 
2.  Feature  Selection  The  three  features  selected  for  testing  represent  different  user  interactions:  1.  User  Registration  (New  Customer)  -  Testing  account  creation  with  input  validation  2.  Create  A  Product  3.  Product  Search  (Guest  User)  -  Testing  the  search  functionality  available  to  all  
visitors
 
3.  Feature  1:  User  Registration   
3.1  Step  1:  Identify  Input  &  Output  Variables  
Input  Variables:  -  First  name  (text)  -  Last  name  (text)  -  Email  address  (text)  -  Password  (text)  -  Date  of  birth  (date)  
Output  Variables:  -  Success  message  "Registration  successful"  -  Error  message  "Invalid  input"  -  Error  message  "Email  already  exists"

3.2  Step  2:  Identify  Equivalence  Classes  
For  Email  Address  Field:   Condition  Valid  Equivalence  Classes  Invalid  Equivalence  Classes  
Email  format  Valid  email  format  (user@domain.com)  
Missing  @  symbol,  Missing  domain,  Special  characters  
Email  length  5  ≤  length  ≤  100  characters  length  <  5,  length  >  100  
Email  uniqueness  Email  not  in  database  Email  already  registered   
For  Password  Field:   Condition  Valid  Equivalence  Classes  Invalid  Equivalence  Classes  
Password  length  8  ≤  length  ≤  50  characters  length  <  8,  length  >  50  
Password  complexity  Contains  uppercase,  lowercase,  number  
Missing  required  character  types   
For  Date  of  Birth  Field:   Condition  Valid  Equivalence  Classes  Invalid  Equivalence  Classes  
Age  requirement  Age  ≥  18  years  Age  <  18  years  
Date  validity  Valid  date  format  (DD/MM/YYYY)  
Invalid  date  (e.g.,  32/13/2025)

3.3  Step  3:  Selecting  Test  Cases  In  this  step,  test  cases  are  selected  to  ensure  complete  coverage  of  all  identified  
equivalence
 
classes
 
while
 
minimizing
 
redundancy.
 
According
 
to
 
the
 
domain
 
testing
 
principle,
 
at
 
least
 
one
 
test
 
case
 
should
 
be
 
chosen
 
from
 
each
 
equivalence
 
class,
 
as
 
tests
 
within
 
the
 
same
 
class
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
produce
 
the
 
same
 
outcome.
 
For
 
the
 
Register
 
New
 
User
 
feature,
 
valid
 
classes—such
 
as
 
correctly
 
formatted
 
email
 
addresses,
 
acceptable
 
password
 
lengths,
 
and
 
valid
 
dates
 
of
 
birth—are
 
represented
 
by
 
test
 
cases
 
that
 
together
 
verify
 
the
 
successful
 
registration
 
process.
 
Invalid
 
classes—such
 
as
 
missing
 
“@”
 
in
 
an
 
email,
 
passwords
 
that
 
are
 
too
 
short,
 
or
 
users
 
under
 
18
 
years
 
old—are
 
each
 
represented
 
by
 
one
 
test
 
case
 
to
 
confirm
 
the
 
system
 
properly
 
rejects
 
those
 
inputs.
 
This
 
systematic
 
selection
 
strategy
 
ensures
 
that
 
every
 
significant
 
input
 
condition,
 
both
 
valid
 
and
 
invalid,
 
is
 
tested
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
without
 
duplicating
 
effort.
 
As
 
a
 
result,
 
the
 
test
 
suite
 
effectively
 
balances
 
coverage
 
and
 
efficiency,
 
focusing
 
testing
 
effort
 
on
 
the
 
most
 
meaningful
 
input
 
variations.
 
3.4  Step  4:  Boundary  Value  Analysis  Boundary  value  analysis  (BVA)  focuses  on  testing  the  edges  of  input  domains,  as  
software
 
systems
 
are
 
most
 
likely
 
to
 
fail
 
at
 
these
 
boundaries
 
rather
 
than
 
within
 
the
 
middle
 
of
 
valid
 
ranges.
 
For
 
the
 
Register
 
New
 
User
 
feature,
 
this
 
approach
 
is
 
applied
 
to
 
input
 
fields
 
that
 
have
 
explicit
 
limits
 
or
 
thresholds,
 
such
 
as
 
password
 
length
 
and
 
user
 
age.
 
For
 
example,
 
if
 
the
 
password
 
requirement
 
is
 
between
 
8
 
and
 
50
 
characters,
 
test
 
cases
 
are
 
designed
 
at
 
the
 
lower
 
and
 
upper
 
limits—7,
 
8,
 
9,
 
49,
 
50,
 
and
 
51
 
characters—to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
correctly
 
enforces
 
these
 
boundaries.
 
Similarly,
 
for
 
the
 
age
 
requirement
 
of
 
18
 
years,
 
test
 
cases
 
are
 
selected
 
just
 
below,
 
at,
 
and
 
above
 
the
 
threshold
 
(ages
 
17,
 
18,
 
and
 
19)
 
to
 
verify
 
proper
 
validation.
 
By
 
emphasizing
 
these
 
edge
 
cases,
 
boundary
 
value
 
analysis
 
increases
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
detecting
 
off-by-one
 
or
 
inequality
 
logic
 
errors,
 
which
 
are
 
common
 
in
 
input
 
validation.
 
This
 
ensures
 
that
 
the
 
registration
 
process
 
handles
 
extreme
 
or
 
limit
 
conditions
 
consistently
 
and
 
reliably.
 
4.  Feature  2:  Create  A  Product  
4.1  Step  1:  Identify  Input  &  Output  Variables  Inputs:  
Input  Variables:  -  Product  Name  (text)  -  Description  (text)  

--- Page 6 ---
  UNIVERSITY  OF  SCIENCE  FACULTY  OF  INFORMATION  TECHNOLOGY  
 -  Stock  (integer)  -  Price  (decimal)  -  Location  Offer  (checkbox)  -  Item  for  Rent  (checkbox)  -  Brand  (drop-down  list)  -  Category  (drop-down  list)  -  CO ₂  Rating  (drop-down  list)  -  Image  (selection  field)  
Outputs:  -  Success  message  “Product  created  successfully”  -  Error  message  “Invalid  input”  -  Field-specific  error  messages  (e.g.,  “Name  is  required”,  “Price  must  be  greater  
than
 
zero”,
 
“Stock
 
must
 
be
 
a
 
whole
 
number”)
 
4.2  Step  2:  Identify  Equivalence  Classes   Condition  Valid  Equivalence  Classes  Invalid  Equivalence  Classes  
Product  Name  1  ≤  length  ≤  100  characters  length  =  0  (empty),  length  >  100  
Description  non-empty  text  empty  description  
Stock  integer  0  ≤  stock  ≤  10  000  stock  <  0,  non-integer  (e.g.  2.5),  exceeds  10  000  
Price  decimal  >  0  (e.g.  0.01  –  9999.99)  
0  or  negative  value,  non-numeric  input  
Brand  selected  from  list  missing  selection  
Category  selected  from  list  missing  selection  
CO ₂  Rating  selected  from  defined  options  (A  –  E)  
missing  or  undefined  rating

 Image  valid  image  file  selected  missing  image  or  unsupported  file  type  
 
4.3  Step  3:  Selecting  Test  Cases  In  this  step,  test  cases  are  chosen  to  represent  all  identified  equivalence  classes  for  the  
Create
 
Product
 
feature
 
while
 
minimizing
 
redundancy.
 
Each
 
input
 
field
 
is
 
analyzed
 
to
 
ensure
 
both
 
valid
 
and
 
invalid
 
conditions
 
are
 
covered
 
at
 
least
 
once.
 
Valid
 
equivalence
 
classes,
 
such
 
as
 
a
 
properly
 
formatted
 
product
 
name,
 
positive
 
numeric
 
price,
 
and
 
integer
 
stock
 
quantity
 
within
 
the
 
allowed
 
range,
 
are
 
represented
 
by
 
test
 
cases
 
that
 
simulate
 
a
 
successful
 
product
 
creation.
 
Invalid
 
equivalence
 
classes,
 
such
 
as
 
an
 
empty
 
name
 
field,
 
negative
 
stock
 
value,
 
or
 
non-numeric
 
price,
 
are
 
each
 
represented
 
by
 
a
 
distinct
 
test
 
case
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
appropriately
 
rejects
 
incorrect
 
inputs.
 
This
 
method
 
follows
 
the
 
principle
 
that
 
executing
 
multiple
 
tests
 
within
 
the
 
same
 
equivalence
 
class
 
would
 
be
 
redundant,
 
as
 
they
 
are
 
expected
 
to
 
yield
 
the
 
same
 
outcome.
 
Therefore,
 
one
 
“best
 
representative”
 
test
 
is
 
selected
 
for
 
each
 
equivalence
 
class
 
to
 
achieve
 
optimal
 
coverage.
 
This
 
ensures
 
that
 
all
 
possible
 
input
 
scenarios—valid,
 
invalid,
 
and
 
edge
 
conditions—are
 
systematically
 
validated
 
while
 
maintaining
 
testing
 
efficiency.
 
4.4  Step  4:  Boundary  Value  Analysis  Boundary  value  analysis  (BVA)  is  applied  in  this  step  to  identify  potential  defects  that  
may
 
occur
 
at
 
the
 
edges
 
of
 
valid
 
input
 
ranges
 
for
 
the
 
Create
 
Product
 
feature.
 
This
 
approach
 
focuses
 
on
 
testing
 
values
 
at,
 
just
 
below,
 
and
 
just
 
above
 
defined
 
boundaries—since
 
errors
 
often
 
arise
 
from
 
incorrect
 
handling
 
of
 
inequality
 
conditions.
 
For
 
example,
 
the
 
Stock
 
field,
 
which
 
accepts
 
positive
 
integers,
 
should
 
be
 
tested
 
with
 
values
 
such
 
as
 
0,
 
1,
 
and
 
−1
 
to
 
confirm
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
rejects
 
negative
 
or
 
zero
 
quantities
 
if
 
not
 
allowed.
 
Similarly,
 
for
 
the
 
Price
 
field,
 
boundary
 
test
 
cases
 
are
 
created
 
around
 
the
 
lower
 
limit
 
(e.g.,
 
0,
 
0.01,
 
and
 
0.02)
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
 
application
 
properly
 
enforces
 
a
 
minimum
 
positive
 
price.
 
The
 
Product
 
Name
 
field,
 
which
 
may
 
have
 
a
 
character
 
limit
 
(e.g.,
 
1–100
 
characters),
 
should
 
also
 
be
 
tested
 
with
 
boundary
 
inputs
 
of
 
0,
 
1,
 
100,
 
and
 
101
 
characters
 
to
 
verify
 
both
 
length
 
validation
 
and
 
user
 
interface
 
constraints.
 
By
 
emphasizing
 
these
 
extreme
 
yet
 
realistic
 
input
 
values,
 
BVA
 
strengthens
 
test
 
coverage
 
and
 
increases
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
detecting
 
off-by-one
 
errors,
 
validation
 
flaws,
 
or
 
incorrect
 
field
 
constraints,
 
ensuring
 
the
 
product
 
creation
 
module
 
performs
 
reliably
 
across
 
all
 
edge
 
conditions.

5.  Feature  3:  Search  And  Filter  Product  
5.1  Step  1:  Identify  Input  &  Output  Variables  Inputs:  
Input  Variables  -  Search  query  (text  string)  -  Selected  category  (checkbox  list)  -  Selected  brand  (checkbox  list)  -  Price  range  (numeric  range:  min–max)  -  CO ₂  rating  (radio  buttons:  A–E)  -  Sort  option  (drop-down)  
Output  Variables  -  List  of  matching  products  displayed  -  Message  “No  products  found”  -  Error  message  “Invalid  input”  (if  applicable)   
5.2  Step  2:  Identify  Equivalence  Classes  
Condition  Valid  Equivalence  Classes  Invalid  Equivalence  Classes  
Search  Query  1  ≤  length  ≤  100  alphanumeric  characters

Category  Selection  one  or  more  categories  selected  from  valid  list  
invalid  category  name,  no  category  selected  (when  required)  
Brand  Selection  valid  brand  selected  non-existent  brand  or  none  selected  (if  required)  
Price  Range  1  ≤  min  <  max  ≤  200  min  ≥  max,  negative  values,  non-numeric  input

undefined  value  or  missing  selection  
Sort  Option  valid  option  selected  (e.g.,  price,  name)  
invalid  or  undefined  sort  option  
5.3  Step  3:  Selecting  Test  Cases  In  this  step,  test  cases  are  selected  to  represent  each  equivalence  class  while  avoiding  
redundancy.
 
For
 
valid
 
classes,
 
test
 
cases
 
are
 
chosen
 
to
 
ensure
 
the
 
full
 
functionality
 
of
 
the
 
search
 
and
 
filter
 
feature—for
 
example,
 
entering
 
a
 
valid
 
keyword,
 
selecting
 
one
 
or
 
more
 
categories,
 
and
 
defining
 
a
 
valid
 
price
 
range
 
should
 
display
 
the
 
corresponding
 
list
 
of
 
products.
 
For
 
invalid
 
classes,
 
each
 
condition
 
such
 
as
 
an
 
empty
 
search,
 
reversed
 
price
 
range
 
(e.g.,
 
min
 
>
 
max),
 
or
 
invalid
 
characters
 
in
 
the
 
search
 
query
 
is
 
represented
 
by
 
one
 
test
 
case
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
handles
 
incorrect
 
inputs
 
gracefully.
 
This
 
approach
 
ensures
 
that
 
each
 
type
 
of
 
input
 
condition
 
is
 
validated
 
at
 
least
 
once
 
while
 
keeping
 
the
 
total
 
number
 
of
 
tests
 
efficient
 
and
 
manageable.
 
5.4  Step  4:  Boundary  Value  Analysis  Boundary  value  analysis  focuses  on  the  limits  of  user  inputs  where  errors  are  most  likely  
to
 
occur.
 
For
 
the
 
Search
 
and
 
Filter
 
feature,
 
boundaries
 
are
 
applied
 
mainly
 
to
 
numeric
 
and
 
text-based
 
fields.
 
The
 
search
 
query
 
length
 
is
 
tested
 
at
 
0,
 
1,
 
2,
 
99,
 
100,
 
and
 
101
 
characters
 
to
 
verify
 
that
 
empty
 
and
 
overly
 
long
 
queries
 
are
 
handled
 
properly.
 
The
 
price
 
range
 
input
 
is
 
tested
 
around
 
its
 
numeric
 
limits,
 
such
 
as
 
(1–200),
 
(0–200),
 
(1–201),
 
and
 
(100–100),
 
to
 
confirm
 
correct
 
validation
 
and
 
behavior
 
at
 
boundary
 
edges.
 
For
 
the
 
filter
 
options
,
 
testing
 
includes
 
selecting
 
none,
 
one,
 
and
 
multiple
 
filters
 
to
 
ensure
 
proper
 
logical
 
handling
 
of
 
selection
 
combinations.
 
Through
 
boundary
 
testing,
 
potential
 
off-by-one
 
or
 
input
 
validation
 
errors
 
can
 
be
 
detected,
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
system
 
performs
 
correctly
 
under
 
both
 
normal
 
and
 
extreme
 
input
 
conditions.
