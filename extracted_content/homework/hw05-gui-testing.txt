1.  Introduction   This  report  applies  GUI  testing  techniques  to  analyzes  Payment  features  from  the  Practice

version:
 https://with-bugs.practicesoftwaretesting.com).  The  analysis  focuses  on  three  different  tasks:  Checklist  of  payment  GUI,  User  survey  and  feedback  and  BrowserStack  
2.  Task  1:  Checklist  of  payment  GUI  
2.1  User  Interface  
2.1.1  Link  ●  I  systematically  clicked  and  inspected  all  links  and  buttons  on  the  checkout  page.  ●  I  checked  that  each  link  navigated  to  the  expected  page  or  triggered  the  intended  
action.
 ●  I  verified  that  external  links  were  active  and  noted  how  they  opened  (same  tab  or  
new
 
tab).
 
I
 
looked
 
for
 
any
 
pages
 
that
 
were
 
unreachable
 
or
 
led
 
to
 
dead-ends.
 ●  I  ensured  that  referenced  websites  and  email  addresses  were  properly  hyperlinked.  
2.1.2  Color  
●  I  observed  the  overall  background  color  to  see  if  it  is  dark  or  light  and  whether  it  
affects
 
readability.
 ●  I  checked  that  different  sections  have  distinct  and  consistent  background  colors.  ●  I  verified  that  normal  text  color  is  uniform  across  the  page.  ●  I  confirmed  that  emphasized  text  (bold,  italic)  and  hyperlinks  stand  out  from  
normal
 
text.
 ●  I  tested  hyperlink  color  changes  on  hover  and  after  being  visited.  ●  I  inspected  input  fields  and  buttons  to  ensure  text  and  background  colors  are  
consistent,
 
and
 
disabled
 
fields
 
are
 
visually
 
distinguishable.

 2.1.3  Content  
●  I  inspected  the  font  type  and  size  across  different  page  elements  (buttons,  inputs,  
text,
 
headings,
 
links)
 
to
 
check
 
for
 
consistency.
 ●  I  verified  that  headings  are  visually  distinct  from  normal  content  and  emphasize  
hierarchy.
 ●  I  checked  alignment  of  all  text  and  headings  to  ensure  proper  layout.  ●  I  reviewed  the  overall  page  structure  and  section  arrangement  for  clarity  and  
readability.
 ●  I  examined  the  display  of  product  lists,  input  fields,  and  buttons  to  confirm  
uniformity
 
and
 
logical
 
grouping.
 ●  I  inspected  error  messages  and  tooltips  for  correctness,  visibility,  and  consistency  
in
 
presentation.
 ●  I  noted  any  missing  elements  such  as  company  information,  privacy  policy,  or  
search
 
bar
 
visibility.
 
2.1.4  Image  
●  I  checked  that  all  images  and  icons  are  properly  aligned.  ●  I  inspected  whether  images  are  optimized  for  size  and  quick  loading.  ●  I  ensured  that  buttons  have  consistent  size,  shape,  and  font.  ●  I  verified  that  banners  display  correctly  and  consistently.  ●  I  checked  that  text  is  positioned  correctly  relative  to  images.  ●  I  observed  page  usability  when  images  are  broken  or  missing.  
2.1.5  Form  
●  I  checked  that  required  and  optional  fields  are  indicated.  ●  I  verified  that  guidance  or  constraints  are  provided  for  complex  input  fields.  ●  I  confirmed  that  default  values  appear  when  the  page  loads  or  reloads.  ●  I  inspected  tables  and  forms  to  ensure  content  is  displayed  correctly  and  
aligned
 
properly.
 ●  I  checked  that  radio  buttons  allow  only  one  selection  per  group.  ●  I  verified  that  checkboxes  can  be  selected  individually  or  in  multiples  where  
available.
 ●  I  checked  that  combo  boxes  or  list  boxes  have  options  in  a  logical  order.

2.2  Usability   
●  I  checked  whether  the  website  clearly  communicates  its  intended  audience.  ●  I  verified  that  the  interface  is  recognizable  and  elements  are  grouped  logically.  ●  I  observed  whether  common  users  can  operate  the  system  without  confusion  or  
frustration.
 
I
 
inspected
 
terminology,
 
buttons,
 
and
 
lists
 
for
 
clarity,
 
completeness,
 
and
 
proper
 
ordering.
 ●  I  checked  for  support  features,  tab  navigation,  and  progress  indicators  during  long  
tasks.
 
2.3  Compatibility  
●  I  checked  whether  the  website  layout  and  text  display  correctly  at  different  screen  
resolutions.
 ●  I  verified  that  colors  and  fonts  are  consistent  and  readable  across  devices.  ●  I  ensured  that  images  and  elements  maintain  proper  alignment  and  sizing  on  
various
 
resolutions.
 ●  I  considered  printer  compatibility,  including  text  and  image  alignment,  colors,  and  
scaling
 
for
 
paper
 
size.
 ●  I  noted  whether  tables  and  page  content  print  clearly  without  cutting  off  
information.
