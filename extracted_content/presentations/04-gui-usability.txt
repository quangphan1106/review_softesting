What is GUI testing?
GUI testing is the process of examining everything 
a user sees and interacts with on a screen. 
We check elements like buttons, menus, input 
ﬁelds, images, icons, visual design,... to ensure 
they work as intended.
GUI and UI ?

--- Page 6 ---
UI vs. GUI
What's the 
relationship?
UI (User Interface)
● All interaction methods.
● Includes voice, gesture, 
command-line, touch, 
physical buttons.
GUI (Graphical User Interface)
● A type of UI that uses graphics: 
buttons, icons, colors, windows, 
menus.
● What we see in web apps, mobile 
apps, desktop apps

--- Page 7 ---
Why is GUI Testing Important?

--- Page 8 ---
Why is GUI Testing Important?
User-Centric Focus: 
The UI is the main point of interaction, so 
its reliability is crucial for a positive user 
experience.
Find & Fix Defects: 
The primary goal is to ﬁnd visual 
defects, making the app appealing 
and user-friendly.
Example: A payment button is poorly placed or 
hard to ﬁnd.
The page looks broken and 
unprofessional.
Users abandon their shopping 
cart, leading to lost sales.
Example: On a speciﬁc phone, the product's 
description text overlaps the product's image.

--- Page 9 ---
Why is GUI Testing Important?
Ensure Visual Consistency: 
We must verify the software looks the 
same across different devices and 
platforms.
Protect Brand Reputation: 
A polished, bug-free UI enhances brand 
reputation and helps detect bugs early, 
which reduces ﬁxing costs.
Example: A page looks ﬁne on Chrome but 
misaligned on Firefox or Safari.
Users lose trust:
 “If they can’t ﬁx the UI, can they 
protect my money?”
Hundreds of cross-browser 
complaints.
Example: A banking app shows clipped text 
on the homepage.

How We Test: The GUI Checklist
A GUI Checklist is a predeﬁned list of criteria used to validate the interface.
It helps us systematically check elements. We've organized our checklist into 4 main 
categories following the template provided:
1. Colors (Checking for consistency and proper design)
2. Content (Checking fonts, alignment, spacing, and spelling)
3. Images (Checking for correct display, alignment, and visual consistency)
4. Form (Checking labels, input ﬁelds, and states)

SELENIUM
Selenium is an automation framework that controls a web browser 
just like a real user.
It allows testers to simulate actions such as clicking, typing, scrolling, 
and checking UI properties.
For this seminar,
We are focusing on using Selenium to demo some tests about the visual 
aspects of the GUI (layout, visuals, color, and position).

--- Page 15 ---
SELENIUM
✔ Free & Open Source
No license, no subscription, no restrictions — anyone can use it.
✔ Automates Repetitive GUI Checks
Instead of manually checking every product card, button, or label, 
Selenium can repeat the same UI checks hundreds of times without 
mistakes.
 Good?
--- Page 16 ---
SELENIUM
✔ Reads UI Properties Directly
Selenium can extract CSS values such as color, font-size, spacing, 
margin, position, and visibility, letting us verify UI consistency 
automatically.
✔ Basic but Very Practical
Selenium isn’t “AI smart,” but it’s extremely reliable for consistent, 
rule-based UI testing.
Good?
--- Page 17 ---
SELENIUM
High Maintenance: Test scripts are "brittle". If a developer changes 
the UI, the script will often break and must be manually updated by 
the tester.
No Built-in Image/Visual Testing: By default, Selenium cannot see 
and feel. It cannot tell whether the text color is readable on the 
background. It can only read the CSS code.
Bad?
Selenium can be extended with visual testing tools and plugins, 
making it ﬂexible and highly effective for GUI testing.

DEMO 1 - Spelling Check
Goal: To automatically ﬁnd both visible and hidden text content for spelling errors that 
damage brand reputation and user trust.
Checklist:
● 1.2.15 (visible): Are all UI component texts (buttons, menus, labels) spelled correctly?
● 1.2.14 (hidden): Are all tooltip/help texts spelled correctly?

--- Page 20 ---
DEMO 1 - Spelling Check
Selenium + Python library p y spellcheck er .
Why use Automation?
● Hidden Text: Manual testers often forget to hover over every icon to check tooltips.
● Human Eye: Our brains auto-correct typos (e.g., reading "Contakt" as "Contact").
● Solution: Selenium reads the raw code and catches errors.

--- Page 21 ---

--- Page 22 ---
DEMO 2 - Color Consistency
Goal: To automatically audit the color consistency of speciﬁc UI components (CO2 Badges & 
Pagination) across multiple pages.
Checklist:
● 1.1.3: Are section colors clearly differentiated and consistent with the design?
● 1.1.9: Are the background colors of  UI components groups (buttons) consistent with 
each other?

--- Page 23 ---
DEMO 2 - Color Consistency
It speciﬁcally targets:
● CO2 Badges: Verifying that each rating (A, B, C, D, E) has its own unique, 
consistent color on every product card.
● Pagination: Verifying that the "Active" page number always uses the standard 
blue background.
Imagine this page has 
more than 200 
products?
--- Page 24 ---

--- Page 25 ---
DEMO 3 - Layout & Image Check
Goal: To use Selenium to scan a list of components and ﬁnd complex layout, consistency, 
and image bugs in Mobile Emulation mode then compare with Desktop mode.
Checklist:
● 1.2.11: Is the product listing section displayed consistently?
● 1.3.1: Are all essential images (product’s image) displayed correctly?
● 1.2.6: Is all text aligned correctly (left, right, center) depending on the design?
This script is conﬁgured to run in Mobile Emulation mode to simulate an iPhone.

--- Page 26 ---
DEMO 3 - Layout & Image Check
For each product card, I check the layout size, the product image visibility, the presence of 
title/price/CO₂ badge, whether tooltips exist, and whether the fonts and alignments remain 
consistent across all items.

Browser Compatibility 
 Ensuring a consistent user experience for everyone, everywhere.
--- Page 31 ---
What is Browser Compatibility Testing?
WHAT?
Testing a web app across all 
browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari), 
operating systems (Windows, 
macOS, iOS), and devices 
(desktops, tablets, phones).
WHY?
Because browsers interpret code 
(HTML, CSS, JS) differently.
GOAL
To ensure a consistent, functional, 
and usable experience for ALL 
users.

Our Two-Part Testing Strategy
 Local Playwright 
● Test 3 Core Engines + 3 
Page Layouts.
● Fast, free, and efﬁcient. 
Catches 90% of bugs.
 BrowserStack 
● Test on Real Operating 
Systems + Real Hardware.
● Catches the last 10% of 
tricky, device-speciﬁc bugs.

--- Page 33 ---
Approach 1: Local Playwright 
(Automation)
What is it? An automation library 
where we write code to run tests 
automatically. It's fast and repeatable.
Demo Scope: We automated 3 core 
tasks:
1. User Login
2. Searching for an Item
3. Adding an Item to the Cart

--- Page 34 ---
Why These 6 Setups?
The 3 Engines:
● Chromium (for Chrome, 
Opera, Edge)
● Firefox (Gecko)
● WebKit (for all Safari 
browsers)

--- Page 35 ---
Why These 6 Setups?
The 3 Form Factors:
● Desktop (Wide layout, full menus)
● Tablet (Medium layout)
● Mobile (Narrow "hamburger" layout)

--- Page 36 ---
Approach 2: BrowserStack 
(Manual)
What is it?
A cloud platform providing 
access to 3000+ real 
browsers and devices for 
testing. No setup or 
installation required, you test 
live in their cloud.
Free Plan Limit
The free plan gives access 
to live testing, but with a 
major limitation: a 
1-minute session timer 
per device. 
Demo Scope
We ran 5 manual tests:
• Mac (Chrome, Firefox, 
Safari)
• Windows (Chrome, 
Firefox, Edge) 
• iPhone & iPad (Safari)
• Android (Chrome)

BrowserStack: Why Test Real OS & Hardware?
Main Goal: To catch bugs that emulators miss. We test on Real 
Operating Systems and Real Hardware.
--- Page 43 ---
Link Testing
Ensuring every click leads to the right destination.
--- Page 44 ---
What is Link Testing (Link Checking)?
What is it?
● The process of systematically scanning a website to ﬁnd and verify all hyperlinks.
● This includes: Internal links (to your own pages), External links (to other sites), and 
Anchor links (on-page jumps).
Why do we do it? To ﬁnd broken links, which most often lead to a 404 "Not Found" error.

--- Page 45 ---
Why Care About Broken Links?
Reason 1: Bad User Experience (UX)
● It frustrates users and stops them 
from ﬁnding the information they 
need.
● Makes your site seem unprofessional 
and unreliable.
Reason 2: Bad SEO (Search Engine 
Optimization)
● Search engines (like Google) see 
broken links as a sign of a low-quality 
or poorly maintained site.
● This can lower your search ranking, 
making your site harder to ﬁnd.

--- Page 46 ---
Approach 1: Simple Scan ("Check My Links")
What is it?
● A free Chrome Extension that scans the single page you are currently on.
How it works:
● It instantly crawls the page and highlights all links:
● Green: Valid links
● Red: Broken links
Use Case: Great for a quick check on one page after you've made content edits.
Limitation: Only tests one page at a time, not the whole site.

--- Page 47 ---

--- Page 49 ---
Approach 2: Advanced Audit ("Sitebulb")
What is it?
● A professional, powerful website crawler and SEO audit tool.
● It crawls your entire website, just like Google's bot would.
● (We used the 14-day full-featured trial).
What it provides:
● A complete dashboard and report of all broken links (internal and external) 
across the whole site.
● Provides much deeper analysis for a full, professional audit.

Usability & UX 
Testing03
--- Page 52 ---
Usability and User Experience (UX)
The process of examining how effectively, efﬁciently, and satisfactorily a user can use a 
product to achieve speciﬁc goals, while also assessing the overall feeling and attitude 
of the user toward the system.
We check elements like ease of learning, intuitiveness, task completion time, error 
rates, and user satisfaction to ensure the product provides a positive and meaningful 
interaction.
UX?
--- Page 53 ---
UX vs. Usability
Usability is a type of UX that speciﬁcally focuses on how easy it is to use an 
interface, measuring attributes like efﬁciency, effectiveness, and user satisfaction 
to achieve a speciﬁc goal.
UX (User Experience) is the broad concept encompassing all aspects of the 
end-user's interaction with the company, its services, and its products, focusing 
on the overall feeling, attitude, and emotions.
--- Page 54 ---
Why is UX Testing Important?
Optimize User Flow: The primary goal is to ﬁnd pain points and friction in the user 
journey, making the application efﬁcient and satisfying to use.
Reduce Support Costs: By ensuring the product is intuitive and easy to learn, we 
minimize user confusion, which in turn signiﬁcantly reduces the need for customer 
support and training.
Increase Adoption & Retention: We must verify that the user can easily achieve their 
goals, preventing frustration and increasing the likelihood of users returning and 
recommending the product.
Protect Investment & Revenue: A highly usable and enjoyable product directly 
contributes to higher conversion rates, ensuring the software's success and 
maximizing ROI.

--- Page 55 ---
How We Test: The UX Checklist
A UX Checklist is a predeﬁned list of criteria used to validate the interface.
It helps testers systematically check elements like:
● Navigation
● Error Support & Feedback
● Clarity & Grouping
● Interaction Mechanics
The goal is to ensure that users can complete their tasks efﬁciently, without frustration, 
and have a positive experience throughout the entire process of using the software.

--- Page 56 ---
UX Checklist - User Experience
Usability informs the scenarios and tasks we design for 
our user surveys on platforms like Lookback.io.

LOOKBACK.IO
Lookback.io is a powerful tool because it lets us capture and 
record real user interactions as they navigate a website or app, 
including their screen, facial expressions, and spoken thoughts.
For this seminar
We are focusing on using Lookback.io to test Usability, User 
Experience (UX), clarity of content, and the emotional response 
to the interface design.

--- Page 60 ---
DEMO 
Goal: To comprehensively assess the User Experience (UX) of the application 
across different user roles (Guest, Normal, and Admin) and to identify speciﬁc 
areas for improvement in design and functionality.
Method
Guest and Normal User Assessment (Lookback.io Survey)
Admin User Assessment (One-on-One Qualitative Interview)

Lookback Weaknesses
1. Session Limits
Free trial is restricted to only 5 sessions.
2. Limited Research Customization
Survey/question ﬂows are less ﬂexible compared to tools like Maze or 
UserTesting.
3. Limited Integrations
Few deep integrations with analytics or product management platforms.
Lacks advanced APIs for automation and workﬂow integration.
--- Page 66 ---
“AI-First” Approach04
--- Page 67 ---
What is it?
Manual → Automation → Artiﬁcial Intelligence
AI performs recognition, validation, and decision-making – not predeﬁned rules.
UI is treated like a human would: visually, semantically, behaviorally.

--- Page 68 ---
Traditional UI testing method
How tests identify elements: Uses ﬁxed locators (XPath, CSS, IDs).
Stability: Very fragile — small UI changes break tests.
Validation method: Rule-based assertions (e.g., element exists).
Bug detection: Only detects failures explicitly coded.
Tester skill requirement: Must know scripting, locators, automation 
frameworks.

--- Page 69 ---
AI-First UI Testing testing method
 How tests identify elements: Uses visual, semantic, and contextual 
understanding (like a human).
Stability: Highly stable — AI adapts to layout, text, or structural changes.
Validation method: Smart/visual assertions (layout, spacing, color, UX 
quality).
Bug detection: Detects visual bugs, UI drift, layout shifts, missing content.
Tester skill requirement: Can be done by QA + AI guidance; tech barrier is 
lower.

--- Page 70 ---
AI-First Approach: Mimic human action
Different from other types of testing—such as API or CI/CD tests— UI testing scenarios 
are far more ﬂexible and must reﬂect how real humans perceive and interact with the 
application. 
→ Not only to verify functionality, but to evaluate the overall user experience, visuals, 
and context. Modern AI models excel at this because they learn visual patterns and 
contextual relationships in a way that closely mirrors human perception, making the 
AI-ﬁrst approach a natural ﬁt for UI/UX testing.
--- Page 71 ---
AI-First Approach: Utilize machine ability
Speed Advantage: Executes UI tests far faster than humans.
Expert Knowledge: Learns UI patterns, code logic, and human language.
Consistent Results: No fatigue, no variation, always reliable.
Multi-User Coverage: Adapts to different devices and user behaviors.

--- Page 72 ---
APPLITOOLS
Applitools is an AI-powered visual testing platform designed to 
automatically detect UI bugs by comparing how an application 
should look versus how it actually looks.
For this seminar
We are focusing on using Applitools for automated UI testing 
with Selenium scripts. The platform’s Visual AI analyzes each 
screen and detects regions with abnormal appearance compared 
to the established baseline. It highlights these areas and 
identiﬁes potential UI errors caused by code changes, enabling us 
to quickly spot visual regressions and maintain a consistent user 
interface.

--- Page 73 ---
APPLITOOLS main function:

--- Page 74 ---
APPLITOOLS
This application captures a screenshot during a test case and 
compares it with a baseline image
→ Signiﬁcantly reducing the effort required to write scripts for 
validating every UI element in the browser.
Applitools Eyes supports many languages and frameworks, 
including Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Ruby, Selenium, 
Playwright, Cypress, Appium, and more, and integrates with 
major CI tools, making it ﬂexible for web, mobile, and desktop 
visual testing across different platforms.

--- Page 75 ---
Applitools Demo: Scenario
For this seminar
We conducted visual testing on the ToolShop text search feature by comparing 
images from two versions, SPRINT5 and SPRINT5_WITH-BUGS. This approach 
clearly demonstrates the capability of Applitools’ visual AI model to identify 
differences between interface states.
