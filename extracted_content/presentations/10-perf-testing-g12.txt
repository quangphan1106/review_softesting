Spike
testing
Evaluates how the system reacts to
sudden
surges in user traffic over a short period.
Example: An e-commerce site experiencing a traffic spike during a flash sale must remain functional.
Ensures your application can recover quickly and continue to operate during abrupt demand increases.
What is it?
Why it matters?

--- Slide 3 ---

Scalability
testing
Evaluates whether the system can handle increased traffic by
adding resources
(scaling up or out).
Example: A streaming platform must be scalable to handle millions of users when a popular show is released.
Identifies the system’s capacity to expand through vertical scaling (more power) or horizontal scaling (more servers).
What is it?
Why it matters?

--- Slide 4 ---

Endurance
testing
Checks the system’s performance over an
extended period
under a consistent load (also called Soak testing).
Example: A CRM tool running continuously for days may experience a slowdown over time, impacting reliability.
Identifies issues like memory leaks or performance degradation with prolonged usage. Ensures long-term stability.
What is it?
Why it matters?

--- Slide 5 ---

Volume
testing
Examines system behavior when handling a
large volume of data
(e.g., in the database).
Example: A financial application managing millions of daily transactions must perform without slowdowns.
Essential for big data applications and systems managing intensive data operations.

Scenario A: High Load Strategy (Stress Test)
1.
Ramp-up (10s)
: Rapidly increase from 0 to 100 VUs to simulate a sudden influx of users.
2. Sustain (4m 50s): Maintain steady load at 100 VUs to monitor resource usage (CPU/RAM) and latency over time.
3. Ramp-down (10s): Decrease to 0 VUs to finish the test gracefully.

This covers both unit/API testing and full system testing.
Evaluate application output, processing speed, and response times.
Measure resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
Determine the maximum concurrent users and find bottlenecks.

Why is Performance Testing Critical?
Fast loads prevent abandonment. Shopify data shows bounce rates triple after 3 seconds.
01
Enhances User Experience
Ensures the application can grow with your user base and handle unexpected surges in traffic.
03
Supports Scalability
02
Prevents Downtime
Fixing defects post-release costs 4-5x more than finding them during development (IBM).
04
Reduces Costs
Avoids catastrophic crashes during peak periods (e.g., Black Friday sales), protecting revenue.

Performance Testing Metrics

--- Slide 30 ---

Test Types
Stress testing
Spike testing
Finds the system's breaking point by overloading it.
Tests sudden, intense surges in user traffic.
Load
testing
Scalability testing
Tests expected user load under normal conditions.
Checks if the system can handle growth by adding resources.
Volume testing
Endurance Testing
Tests handling of large amounts of data.
Tests performance over a long period (finds leaks).

--- Slide 31 ---

Load testing
Simulates the
expected
number of users or transactions to assess the system’s behavior under normal conditions.
Example: An e-commerce platform must ensure smooth checkout even when hundreds of users shop during a Black Friday sale.
Ensures critical functionalities (database queries, server responses) meet performance benchmarks during peak usage.
What is it?
Why it matters?

--- Slide 32 ---

Stress
testing
Pushes the system
beyond
its normal operational limits to see how it behaves under extreme conditions.
Example: A ticket booking website for a significant concert must be stress-tested to see how it reacts to a surge in demand.
Helps uncover weaknesses, such as system crashes or slow response times, before they occur in real-world scenarios.
