Introduction
01. Manual vs. Automation
Manual Testing
Performed by humans step-by-step
Best for Exploratory & UX testing.
Prone to fatigue & inconsistency.
Automation Testing
Executed by scripts/tools.
InBest for Regression & Repetitive tasks.
Fast, precise, consistent.
"Automation does not replace humans; it liberates them."

--- Page 5 ---
Introduction
Automation testing is the technique of using 
specific software (scripts) to control the 
execution of tests and compare actual outcomes 
with predicted outcomes.
02. What is Automation Testing?
Software Verifying Software
Eliminates repetitive manual tasks.
Increases test coverage.
Validates software reliability automatically.
Goal: Liberate testers from boring tasks to focus on 
difficult cases.
--- Page 6 ---
03. Desktop App 
Automation
Verifying applications installed directly on the 
Operating System (unlike Web apps in 
browsers).
Key aspects: 
GUI Actions: Clicking, dragging, typing on 
Windows/Dialogs.
CLI Actions: Open CMD , type the command and press 
enter (MAC OS)
Environments: Validating on Windows Forms, WPF, 
JavaFX, etc.
Context Specifics
System Access: Interacting with File System & OS 
permissions.

--- Page 7 ---
Repeatability
Scripts can be executed 
indefinitely without fatigue, 
Accuracy
Eliminates human error. A 
machine will strictly follow the 
script, ensuring precise 
validation of complex GUI 
workflows.
Speed & Effort
Drastically reduces manual 
effort and accelerates 
regression testing cycles, 
allowing faster release of new 
versions.
04. Why do we do it?
--- Page 8 ---
RealityMyths
Only automate stable, repetitive flows.
It compliments manual testing.
ROI is realized in the long term.
05. Common Myths
"Automate everything."
"Automation replaces Manual Testing."
"Automation provides immediate ROI."
--- Page 9 ---
Crucial Phases
Automation is most effective when the application is 
stable.
Best for scenarios where GUI consistency is critical.
Regression Testing: Ensuring new code doesn't 
break existing 7-Zip features.
System Testing: Validating the complete and 
integrated software.
Acceptance Testing: Verifying business 
requirements.
06. Strategy: When to Automate?

--- Page 10 ---
Target Areas
What to Avoid
● Unstable UI: Features currently in development.
● Ad-hoc Tests: One-time checks for edge cases.
● Visual Aesthetics: "Is this icon pretty?" (Leave for 
humans).
Functional UI Tests: Core actions like "Add to 
Archive", "Extract Here".
Smoke Tests: "Sanity" checks (Does the app launch? 
Do critical buttons work?).
End-to-End Workflows: Complete user journey 
validations.
07. Strategy: What to Automate? (Where)

SUT: 7-Zip
What is 7-Zip?
● Open-source file archiver
● Compress and Extract files, for example making .zip or .7z archives.
Why Choose 7-Zip as SUT?
➢Stable UI → ideal for GUI automation
➢Handles file operations (add, extract, list), easy to validate
➢Offers GUI (Windows) + CLI (macOS/Linux), enabling multiple test types

--- Page 14 ---
GUI Automation Path (Windows)
We automate 7-Zip File Manager on Windows.
Key tools:
● Pywinauto – controls the 7-Zip window
 (click buttons, type text, choose options, open dialogs)
● pytest – runs the test functions and checks the results
Typical actions:
● Open 7-Zip File Manager
● Add files → create archive
● Extract archive → verify result

--- Page 15 ---
Automation Tool: Pywinauto
● Python library for Windows GUI applications
● Allows direct interaction with native Windows controls—such 
as buttons, menus, and text boxes
● Uses Win32 API or UI Automation backend.

--- Page 16 ---
Why choosing Pywinauto
● Fast and simple setup: installable with one command (pip install pywinauto) 
without external drivers.
● Full Windows compatibility: works seamlessly on Win32, WPF, and WinForms 
apps.
● Readable API: supports intuitive commands like .Edit.type_keys() and 
.MenuSelect().

Testing Framework: pytest
● Python testing framework used to execute and manage test cases.
●  It automatically discovers functions whose names start with test_ in 
files test_*.py and reports results.

--- Page 20 ---
Why choosing pytest
➢Clean and minimal syntax; easy to integrate with Pywinauto scripts.
➢Generates readable command-line output and supports HTML reporting via plugins 
(pytest-html).
➢Supports core functionalities such as assertions, fixtures, and parameterization

--- Page 21 ---
CLI Automation Path (macOS)
For platforms without 7-Zip GUI (like macOS), we automate using the 7z command-line.
Main idea:
● Use subprocess.run() to execute commands like:
○ 7z a archive.7z file.txt
○ 7z x archive.7z -pPASSWORD
pytest is still the runner, but instead of Pywinauto, tests call the CLI, then check the return code 
and output.

--- Page 22 ---
CLI Libraries & pytest Integration
subprocess
● Runs 7z commands and captures output / return code
openpyxl
● Reads multiple test data from Excel file where each line is 1 test case
zipfile and py7zr
● Programmatically open .zip and .7z archives
● Used to validate that archives created by 7-Zip are actually valid or not

--- Page 23 ---
CLI Libraries & pytest Integration
pytest integration
● All CLI tests are normal pytest test functions (with assert).
● Fixture (setup_test) → create temp folder + sample file before each test.
● parametrize (@pytest.mark.parametrize) → run the same test for every 
row in the Excel test cases data.
--- Page 24 ---
CLI Test Types Implemented
Data-Driven CLI Tests
• Source: Excel files (openpyxl).
• Framework: pytest.mark.parametrize.
• Benefit: Decoupling Test Data from Test Logic.
Happy Path / Functional CLI
• Library: subprocess module.
• Dynamic Arguments: Automatically handles flags (-mx, -p, -tzip).
• Success Criteria: returncode == 0.

--- Page 25 ---
CLI Test Types Implemented
Validation Tests
• Advanced Verification: Beyond simple os.path.exists.
• Cross-check: Utilizing 3rd-party libs (zipfile, py7zr) to extract and verify.
• Goal: Ensure Data Integrity (Not corrupted).
Negative CLI Tests
• Error Capture: Capturing stderr stream.
• Validation: Asserting returncode != 0.
• Keyword Matching: Scanning for "error" or "permission" in logs.

--- Page 26 ---
GUI Test Types Implemented
Data-Driven GUI Tests
• Reusability: Reusing test_data.xlsx from CLI.
• Consistency: Ensures consistent testing across interfaces.
Happy Path / Functional GUI
• Library: pywinauto (UIA Backend).
• Synchronization: Smart wait('visible') instead of hard sleep.
• Workflow: Simulates user actions (Select File -> Add to Archive -> OK).

--- Page 27 ---
GUI Test Types Implemented
Validation Tests
• Hybrid Approach: UI execution with Backend verification.
• Check: Verify output file existence and integrity after UI processing.
Negative GUI Tests
• Popup Detection: Auto-detecting Error Windows (System & App level).
• Assertion: Verifying error message content against expected results.
• Self-Healing: Auto-closing popups to clean the environment.
