--- Slide 7 ---

A type of
non-functional
testing measuring how a system performs under workload
Focus on
responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource usage
Goal: ensure the system meets
performance expectations
before release
,
not finding bugs

Key Concepts and Metrics
{00F7E7D3-B7B1-4650-9F74-2723FDCB75E4}
Term
Definition
Response Time
Time between request submission and response completion
Throughput
Number of transactions or requests handled per second.
Latency
Delay before a response begin
s
Bandwidth
The volume of data transferred per second
Concurrency
Number of simultaneous users or sessions
Error Rate
The percentage of requests resulting in errors
Resource Utilization
CPU, Memory, network, or I/O usage during test execution
Transactions Passed/Failed
Transactions Passed/Failed – the percentage of passed/failed transactions

Types of Performance Testing - WYSIWYG
{00F7E7D3-B7B1-4650-9F74-2723FDCB75E4}
Test Type
What It Evaluates
Example Scenario
Load Testing
System behavior under expected user load
Simulate 100 concurrent users performing normal actions
Stress Testing
System behavior beyond limits until failure
Ramp up to 10,000 users to find the breaking point
Spike Testing
Reaction to sudden, extreme increases in load
Simulate flash-sale traffic suddenly jumping from 50 → 5,000 users
Endurance (Soak) Testing
Stability over long time under steady load
Run a 24-hour continuous API workload to detect memory leaks
Volume Testing
Performance with large data sets (DB size, file size)
Test queries on a 100M-row database or process 10GB input files
Scalability Testing
How performance changes when resources scale
Increase traffic from 500 → 5,000 users while adding nodes to the cluster to check linear scaling

100% Java open-source application for load and performance testing.
It simulates multiple users (threads) sending requests to a server and collects response metrics (latency, throughput, errors).

WHY is
"performance" important
?
User experience
: Slow response times increase drop-offs, reduce engagement, and erode trust;
most users
"
abandon
"
an app if it takes more than a few seconds to load
(Jakob Nielsen’s three response time limits
*
).
Scalability & cost
: Efficient systems handle more users with fewer servers, lowering cloud bills and preventing outages during traffic spikes.
Business impact & reliability
: Performance issues often manifest as downtime, bottlenecks, or cascading failures that directly affect revenue, SLAs (Service-Level Agreements), and reputation.
